        <h1>Client Report</h1>
        <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
        <p>Deciding the content and images was actually pretty easy, since the website was being made for my dad, I could ask him for most of the images and content he wanted one it. I then refined it and added a bit of my own stuff to better fit the plan I had drawn out, such as lengthening things that seemed too short or writing new blocks of text to fill space.</p>
        <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
        <p>I communicated with the developer through email. Eveything went smoothly, except when I missed seeing the email he sent with the link to the website.</p>
        <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely. Aside from the fact that the about page is just a blank html page that says "This is the about page," Everything is great. I would have done certain things in the website slightly differently, but that's more stylistic choices than anything. Overall, I'm satisfied with the website.</p>
        <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
        <p>I'll try to keep in touch with them better, and try to be more specific with my site plans.</p>

        <h1>Lead Developer Report</h1>
        <h2>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
        <p>I mainly talked in person with them. There wasn't much overall to discuss with them.</p>
        <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h2>
        <p>Again, I spoke with him mainly in person. There was an issue where I didn't have enough images for the website, so I spoke with him and he emailed me the images.</p>
        <h2>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
        <p>Putting it on Github gave me some problems at the start, but I was able to get it working. I emailed the link to my client, and I saw him looking at it, so that apparently worked.</p>
        <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
        <p>It wasn't my first time using Github, so the general workflow was nothing new. It was my first time using it to host a website though, and that gave me some problems. It's also been a while since I've used Github in tandem with someone else for a long period of time, so I had to relearn how to deal with everything.</p>

        <h1>Junior Developer Report</h1>
        <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
        <p>There was a bit of difficulty finding my lead devs at the start, but overall everything went fine. The only major problem was when on of the lead devs changed something in how index.html was structured and it completely messed up my page, but it was relatively easy to fix.</p>
        <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
        <p>Yes, it was fairly simple with both of the websites. The site plans were well made and contained all the miages and content I needed.</p>
        <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
        <p>Yes. I made (and styled, where applicable) one subpage on each of the websites in which I was a junior developer.</p>
        <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
        <p>Only a few commit conflicts. There was one time my entire page got reverted once and I had to undo the commit. But other than that everything else turned out fine</p>
        <br>

        <h1>General Questions</h1>
        <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
        <p>Probably working with other people without communicating with them constantly. I approached this mainly by just keeping everything I did as unobtrusive as possible. I avoided modifying the html or css of anyone else, and worked to make my pages fit the already existinig css as much as possible.</p>
        <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
        <p>I liked working with other people. It was fun to throw together html using someone else's stylesheet and someone else's idea. It was just raw programming, and felt fun. Like doing a color-by-number book.</p>
        <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
        <p>I would work on communicating better with my teams, and making sure that everything works well together. There were a couple times where the lead developer changed something small and it broke my whole page, and that could be mitigated with better communication.</p>
        <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
        <p>Absolutely. I feel like I have a firm understanding of both how to make a website and how to work wth others one a large project.</p>
